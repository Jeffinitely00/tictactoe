1.) First we need to attach event (submit) listener to the form to get user data
2.) Then attach event listeners to each "game box"
3.) Then, intinialize game
3.) Then, we need to check which game mode we're playing
4.) Need to set win condition
5.) Need to determine current player
6.) After each move, check win conditions and if not met, set other player as active
7.) Game Modes: Human vs human, easy ai, impossibl ai

Challenges;

1.) Getting my Ai to beat me so I could debug 
2.) I was not able to implement the impossible Ai. minimax is beyond my knowledge at this time
